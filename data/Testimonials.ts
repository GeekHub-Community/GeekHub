      thoughts:'At the beginning of my college journey I had some previous knowledge in coding but did not know my next step to proceed. Its when I discovered GeekHub, it not only helped me find my passion and choose the right domain, but also gave me unforgettable memories. Later when I became a mentor at Geekhub, I tried to helped my juniors find their passion because thats what a community does'
